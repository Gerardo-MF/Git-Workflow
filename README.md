4. Click on new organitation
3. Choose the plan and fill up data

### Create a fork

For creating a fork you must sign in on Github and then go to the landing page's project of whatever fork you want to do. 

## Working with remotes repositores

Display remotes repositories
` git remote -v`

Add a remote repository
`git remote add {name} {URL}`

Delete a remote link
`git remote remove {Name}`


## Creating tags

It is neccesary to understand that the tags only have to be created on the master branch as a good practice.
